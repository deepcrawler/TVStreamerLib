 * ###Overview
 * The DiscoveryManagerListener will receive events on the addition/removal/update of ConnectableDevice objects.
 *
 * ###In Depth
 * It is important to note that, unless you are implementing your own device picker, this listener is not needed in your code. TVCastLib's DevicePicker internally acts a separate listener to the DiscoveryManager and handles all of the same method calls.
